## ðŸš€ Key Features & Highlights

### Intuitive Post Display:

Posts are presented in an easy-to-read format, prioritizing clarity and readability.

### Efficient State Management:

The app employs a well-structured approach to state management, likely using React's `useState` hook or a more advanced solution like the Context API or a state management library (if applicable). This ensures data consistency and responsiveness across components.

### Reusable Components:

The app's modular architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability. Key components include:

*   **`MainHeader`:** Provides the main navigation or header section of the app.
*   **`Modal`** (If applicable): Handles the display of modal windows for actions like creating new posts.
*   **`NewPost`:** (If applicable): Facilitates the creation of new posts.
*   **`Post`:** Represents an individual post item, displaying its content and possibly interactions.
*   **`PostsList`:** Dynamically renders a list of `Post` components based on the app's data.

### Clean Project Structure:

*   **`src/components`:** Houses the core reusable UI components.
*   **`src/App.jsx`:** Serves as the main entry point of the app.
*   **`src/main.jsx`:** Handles the initial rendering of the app into the DOM.
